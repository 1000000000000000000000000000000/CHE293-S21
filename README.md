Scripts for getting descriptors

Scripts must be run from the same directory (folder) that they are installed in!
Vkbat script requires perl to be installed or JPred will not work

Run via "java -jar [script-name] [sequence-1] [sequence-2] ... [sequence-n]"

replace [script-name] with the name of the script you are running
replace [sequence-x] with the amino acid primary sequence
separate sequences by spaces
